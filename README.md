# Northwind MySQL
Description: This repository contains files of my analyses of Northwind sales data using MySQL.

## Analytical Report
The information in the README.md file below contains instructions and helpful information for replicating all analyses. For a detailed report that walks through the analytical process, please visit my [website](https://nrgreenup.github.io/An-Exploration-of-Northwind-Using-MySQL/).

## Installation and File Execution
To begin, download both .sql files into a folder. Run the data installation script file before the analysis file. The code should execute in any MySQL compatible GUI.
